# isomprphism checker for CS290B

# isomprph.c 	: routines to check two graphs based on incident edges of
#              	  a specific color
# iso_check.c	: routine that reads two graphs in and calls isomorph checking
#                 functions from isomorph.c
# jrb.[ch]	: red-black tree implementation due to Jim Plank

#
# to run
#	iso_check -f file1 -g file2
# where
#	file1 and file2 contain adjacency matricies and a dimension
#
# adjacency input file format is size and a second int (which is ignored) on
# the first line followed by lines of 0s and 1s, each indicating the colors of 
# edges between the nodes denoted by the matrix subscripts.  Only the upper
# triangle is recognized
#
# for example
#	10 0
#	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0
#	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
#	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
#	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1
#	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
#	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
#	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
#	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
# 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
#	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

# if a valid input file on 10 nodes.  Note that the spaces and line breaks are
# necessary
#
# the three test files
# test.state is an isomorph with test1.state
# test.state is not an isomorph with test2.state
